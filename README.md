<h1> FreshCart - a win-win-win solution to fight food waste in Kazakhstan </h1>
With population growth, the number of restaurants and other food-promoting organizations also increases. Therefore, at the end of the day, the number of leftovers is numerous in this industry. For good sales, restaurants and supermarkets are forced to get rid of products that lose commercial form, giving birth to food waste. Food waste is food that was intended for human consumption but is wasted and lost. 

We were shocked that although food waste exacerbates other global issues such as famine, poverty and global warming, it is still underappreciated in our country (Kazakhstan). In our region, the percentage of food that is thrown away is up to 40%, according to the “Foodprint” investigations. It means that 1200 thousand tons are being wasted annually. Moreover, out of 100kg of wasted food, 78 is considered to be edible. Obviously, the main food waste distributors are catering companies. Therefore, we behold a huge point in working on providing possibilities for establishments to sell their products. 

What shocked us more is that there are no solutions of food waste problem in Kazakhstan, so we decided to change the situation: 

**FreshCart is a triple win**: business win, because they save money; clients' win since they can buy quality food on sales and ecological win as it benefits the environment. 

**FreshCart** is an ecosystem of  consisting of mobile applications and web platform, that provide an opportunity for supermarkets, restaurants, cafes, canteens, and other food-promoting establishments to be able to deal with leftovers that can be thrown away at the end of the working day. Using our platform catering companies will upload near-expiry products and customers will purchase it for lower prices.
